# Tatty-screen.js

> Simple ES6 green screen teleprinter in the browser


## Getting Started

```
bower install --save tatty-screen
```

This is an ES6 module compiled with [Traceur](https://github.com/google/traceur-compiler) so youâ€™ll need that.


## Building

```
git clone git@github.com:mattstyles/tatty-screen.git
npm install
bower install
npm run build
```

Also, a file watcher because watching and reacting is the shit

```
npm run watch
```
